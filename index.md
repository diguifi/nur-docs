## NuR
### About
NuR is a game about running.
To where?
I don't know, you're the only one who can answer this. If it will be towards the highest distance, if it will be towards the most orbs, coolest skins and powers ups, or if it will be towards thinking and questioning what is it all about after all.

### Features
NuR in it's essence is an endless-runner arcade game. In it you run and avoid obstacles, while also interacting with a character called Sci, which helps you and talks to you about your journey.  
Recently the game has added two new features: Leaderboards and Achievements, via Google Play Games. To be able to do so, the game needs to authenticate the user, using Google's OAuth system. No data is ever stored by the game NuR, and we only need the OAuth login to be able to update user's placement on the leaderboards and hand proper achievements to user's Play Games account.
