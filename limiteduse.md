# Use of Google API Services
## Google API Services Disclosure
NuR uses Google’s Application Programming Interface (API) Services to enable the user authorization feature for accessing the game (i.e. use of your Gmail account to login to the game).

NuR’s use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## Types of Data Collected with Google API Services
In connection with the Google API services that we use for our game, we integrate Google user authentication credentials into our game to enable Google-based login to the game. The information collected and used with these API services may include confidential data (e.g. login credentials or sensitive information included within your emails) and personal data (e.g. personal information included within your emails).

“Confidential Data” means data that may contain sensitive or restricted information that should only be accessible to authorized personnel, including, for example, user login credentials, or other sensitive information that should not be made public.

"Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We use, but do not store Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described within the practices below. To the extent that Anonymous Data is linked to your Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data.

## Use of Google API Services Data
Your Google information is used by our system developers to provide features that are prominent to your user experience, they are "Leaderboards" and "Achievements". NuR policies and procedures define requirements that prohibit the unauthorized use of data within the game.

Developers are never allowed to use or transfer restricted scope data to serve users advertisements. This includes personalized, re-targeted and interest-based advertising. Additionally, developers do not allow humans to read restricted scope user data. For example, a developer with access to a user's data will not have one of its employees read through a user's emails.

## Data Privacy
We place significant importance on maintaining the security and privacy of your data. Reference our [Privacy Policy](https://diguifi.github.io/nur-docs/privacy) for information on our privacy policies regarding the use of the game and its services.
